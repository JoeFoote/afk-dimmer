# AFK Dimmer
This plugin is meant to dim the screen to a desired brightness
when the player is 'AFK'. The plugin will check the seconds since the players last keyboard or mouse
input and dim once the alloted time is reached. The screen will undim when the player
makes a new mouse or keyboard input. There is also a flag set so the screen will 
undim when the player character is 'idle'.
